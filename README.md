# burger
In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM.

# Eat-Da-Burger!
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour It!" button. When clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not.
